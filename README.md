# Unix-Final-Project
This repository contains all the important files you will need to build your own static or normal website. We have an `INSTALL.md` file which will give you all the essential installations you will need for your own websites. There is images for for almost all the commands we used in this whole repository. You can use our websites as a test website to check how to put the website into the Nginx path inside the VPS. For Jekyll, you can follow our steps on `INSTALL.md` file.
