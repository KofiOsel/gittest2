      <h1>The Importance of Tourism in Egypt</h1>
      <p>Tourism in Egypt is one of the most important sources of national income, with the annual dollar revenues 
	     it provides, and the foreign currency returns that enabled it to participate significantly in the gross 
		 domestic product, and to combat unemployment by employing a wide segment of the workforce in Egypt. Egypt 
		 is one of the most prominent tourist countries in the world, with its number of tourists arriving in the 
		 world, and it is distinguished by the abundance of tourist attractions of all kinds, the spread of temples, 
		 museums, monuments, historical and artistic buildings and vast gardens on its land, and its possession of 
		 strong infrastructure based on serving the tourism sector, including Hotel rooms, villages, tourist resorts, 
		 tourism companies and airline offices. In this paper, we present an overview of tourism in Egypt and its 
		 impact on the Egyptian economy based on a data published by the World Tourism Organization (2019) and by 
		 the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, 2017. We indicate the types of tourism in Egypt. We present 
		 the factors which have an impact on tourism in Egypt. </p>
      <p>Finally, At its peak in 2010, the sector employed about 12% of workforce of Egypt, serving approximately 14.7 
	     million visitors to Egypt, and providing revenues of nearly $12.5 billion as well as contributing more than 
		 11% of GDP and 14.4% of foreign currency revenues.</p>

            <h2>Luxor's Karnak Temple and the Valley of the Kings</h2>
            <p>Famed for the Valley of the Kings, Karnak Temple, and the Memorial Temple of Hatshepsut, 
			   the Nile-side town of Luxor in Upper Egypt has a glut of tourist attractions.</p>
            <p>This is ancient Thebes, power base of the New Kingdom pharaohs, and home to more sights 
			   than most can see on one visit.</p>
			<p>While Luxor's East Bank holds the modern city, with its vibrant souq; the two temples 
			   of Karnak and Luxor; and the museum; the West Bank's lush farmland and barren cliffs 
			   are where the vast majority of Luxor's tourist attractions sit, with so many tomb and 
			   temple sights that it has been called the biggest open-air museum in the world.</p>

            <h2>Pyramids of Giza</h2>
            <p>The last surviving of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, the Pyramids of Giza are one of 
			   the world's most recognizable landmarks.</p>
            <p>Having awed travelers down through the ages, these tombs of the Pharaohs Cheops (Khufu), 
			   Chephren (Khafre), and Mycerinus (Menkaure), guarded by the enigmatic Sphinx, are usually 
			   top of most visitor's lists of tourist attractions to see in Egypt and often the first 
			   sight they head to after landing.</p>
			<p>Today, sitting on the desert edge of Cairo's sprawl, these megalithic memorials to dead 
			   pharaohs are still as wondrous a sight as they ever were and an undeniable highlight of 
			   any Egypt trip.</p>

			   banks of the river on the route between Luxor and Aswan, plus sunrise and sunset 
			   over the date-palm-studded river banks, backed by sand dunes, is one of Egypt's 
			   most tranquil vistas.</p>
