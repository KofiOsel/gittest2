            <h1>Tourism In Egypt</h1>
			<p>Why travel to Egypt when there are so many other interesting countries 
			   one can visit? The short and simple answer is because no other country 
			   in the world can be compared to Egypt. This is why Egypt is one of the 
			   most frequently visited countries for travelers and tourists of all kinds, 
			   regardless of age, race or gender.People travel to Egypt because of its rich 
			   and “intoxicating” culture, and for the numerous activities and historical 
			   sites that one can visit and explore.</p>
            <p>Home of the ancient Pharaohs, Egypt is a destination full of dazzling 
			   temples and tombs that wow all who visit. It's not all historic treasures
			   and tourist attractions, though. With vast tracts of desert for 4WD adventures, 
			   the Red Sea's world-class coral reefs and wrecks for divers, and cruising
			   on the famed Nile River, there are plenty of things to do for all types of 
			   travelers. Beach lovers head to the Sinai or the Red Sea Coast to soak up 
			   the sun, while archaeology fans will have a field day in Luxor.Cairo is 
			   the megalopolis that can't be beaten for city slickers, while Siwa oasis 
			   and the southern town of Aswan offer a slice of the slow pace of the countryside. 
			   With so much to see and do, Egypt offers visitors a chance to create itineraries 
			   that combine culture, adventure, and relaxation all on one trip.</p>
