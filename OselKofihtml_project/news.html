                Elsewhere, Rangers are still looking to replace Steven Gerrard after he left to become Aston
                Villa's new head coach. Twelve teams will take part in the playoffs, drawn into three paths of four
                teams with two semifinals and a final in each. The winners of the three finals will take the last
                European places at the World Cup.<br><br> These are one-off games and there are always adversities. Just
                as
                we would have liked to have avoided Portugal, I think [Portugal] would have gladly avoided Italy.
                Will we get to the World Cup? We are always confident and positive; the most important thing will
                be to have all the players available.<br><br>

                Giovanni van Bronckhorst is a strong contender for the job, as reported by The Athletic last
                week. Italy manager Roberto Mancini told RAI2: "It hasn't been a great draw, it could have gone better.
                We will have to beat North Macedonia and Portugal will have to beat Turkey. In the European playoffs
                also drawn Friday, it will be Scotland versus Ukraine, Wales versus Austria, Russia versus Poland,
                Sweden versus Czech Republic, Italy versus North Macedonia and Portugal versus Turkey.<br><br></p>

            <p> Arsenal Women scored a late goal in their 3-0 win over HB Koge too see them remain second in
                their Champions League group. The four playoff qualifiers noted above from the Asia, South America,
                North America and Oceania continents were drawn in two separate "intercontinental" playoff knockout
                matches that will be played in a neutral venue with a ticket to Qatar on the line.<br><br>

                Substitute Vivianne Miedema added her name to the scoresheet in the 88th minute after a
                through ball by Steph Catley from within Arsenal's half set up the Dutch international. These are
                one-off
                games and there are always adversities. Just as we would have liked to have avoided Portugal, I think
